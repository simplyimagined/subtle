  This will return a string describing the current state of the game.
  (Pretty much used for debugging)
  It shows the current state, the answer to the puzzle,
  and a list of any guesses made so far. Each guess will show
  a '!' before any wrong letter and '~' to show a correct letter
  in the wrong position.

  See `Guess`.guess_word/2 to understand the guess structure.

      is in the wrong position, the third "p" is correct, there
      is no "l", and the final "e" is in the wrong postion.
