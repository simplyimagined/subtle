# Subtle

An extremely subtle excercise in learning Elixir LiveView

This was written to practice and test what I've learned from several books while removing the training wheels. Any resemblance to a well-known game is somewhat intentional, though I've never actually played it. Only a few words were harmed in the making of this word game.

This code is a learning excercise only and written by me.

## Try it locally

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
